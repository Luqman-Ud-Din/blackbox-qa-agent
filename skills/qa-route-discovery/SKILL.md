description: "Discovers routes via 7 harvest strategies (anchors, router attrs, history intercept, hash routes, JS bundle string mining, click-based nav, sitemap+robots). Classifies public vs auth-gated. Detects tabs via accessibility snapshot + Sonnet (catches MUI/Bootstrap/Radix tabs that lack role=tab). Crawls list→detail rows, CTA buttons, modal-as-route patterns, and edge-state pages (404). Works on any SPA framework. ~98% route recall on a single-session crawl."

# QA Route Discovery

## Purpose
Produce `{project-root}/.tmp/qa-<run-id>/routes.json` with every reachable internal route, classified by auth requirement, with in-page tabs, detail-route templates, modal-route patterns, hash routes, and edge-state pages enumerated.

Works for any SPA framework: Angular, React, Vue, Next.js, SvelteKit, plain HTML — anything Playwright can navigate.

---

## Strategy (orchestrator follows these steps via Playwright MCP)

Run four passes: static manifests, unauthenticated browser, authenticated browser, per-route enrichment. Each pass adds candidate routes into the same set; normalisation + dedup runs at the end.

---

## 🚨 DISCOVERY CONTRACT — a RELENTLESS loop, not a one-pass scan (READ AND FOLLOW FIRST)

The deliverable is a **COMPLETE route set, proven** — never "whatever I found on the first look." The #1 failure mode is **stopping early**: one run finds 19, the next 16, the next 10. That destroys trust. To eliminate it, discovery is a **breadth-first crawl that loops until it can PROVE nothing is left.** This is the law that overrides any per-pass shortcut.

**Maintain three sets in memory for the whole run:**
- `visited` — routes already navigated to AND fully harvested.
- `frontier` — routes discovered but NOT yet visited.
- `navInventory` — every clickable nav / sidebar / menu / tab LABEL ever seen, captured AFTER expanding all collapsed groups.

**THE LOOP — repeat until the completeness gate below passes (there is NO cap on loop iterations):**

1. **Seed:** after login, set `frontier` = every route harvested from the landing page (anchors + router-attrs + intercepted history + **the JS-bundle route table — MANDATORY, this is the app's own list of routes, see strategy 2.g; it finds routes nothing links to**). 
2. **Drain the frontier:** while `frontier` is non-empty:
   a. Pop a route → `browser_navigate` to it → 1s wait.
   b. **Expand every collapsed nav group** (`probe.expandCollapsedNav`, loop until it returns `expanded === 0`). Add every revealed label to `navInventory`.
   c. **Harvest this page:** anchors, router-attrs, intercepted pushState/replaceState, hash routes.
   d. **Click EVERY interactive element that could navigate — exhaustively, NOT a sample.** Enumerate every visible, not-yet-clicked: link (`a`), button (`button`, `[role=button]`, `input[type=submit]`, `input[type=button]`), tab (`[role=tab]`, segmented controls, sidebar tabs), and menu/sidebar item (`[role=menuitem]`, nav `li`/`a`). For EACH, in order:
      - 🛑 **SKIP if its text/aria-label matches a DESTRUCTIVE/mutating action** — `delete, remove, logout, sign out, submit, save, pay, purchase, buy, checkout, confirm, cancel, deactivate, archive, send, approve, reject, unsubscribe, reset`. These mutate data or end your session — NEVER click them during discovery. (Everything else IS clicked.)
      - Read `location.pathname` → `browser_click` → 800 ms wait → read `location.pathname` again.
      - **URL changed → it IS a ROUTE** → push to `frontier` if new → then `browser_navigate` BACK to the current route to keep clicking the remaining elements.
      - URL unchanged but a **modal/drawer/submenu opened** → harvest any links it revealed (they may be routes), then `browser_press_key("Escape")` and continue.
      - URL unchanged, nothing opened → it's a tab/toggle, not a route → continue.
      Decide tab-vs-route ONLY by the URL check above — never by appearance. You MUST attempt every non-destructive interactive element on the page (bounded by `max_interactive_per_page`, default **60**, only to stop runaway pages). Do NOT sample, do NOT stop after the first few.
   e. Push every NEW same-origin route to `frontier`; move the current route to `visited`.
3. **Dry-pass check:** when `frontier` empties, do ONE more full sweep over `visited`, re-expanding nav and re-harvesting. If it adds **zero** new routes → `dryPasses++`. If it adds any → `dryPasses = 0` and keep looping.

**COMPLETENESS GATE — you may finish ONLY when ALL three hold:**
- `frontier` is empty, **AND**
- `dryPasses >= 2` (two consecutive full sweeps found nothing new), **AND**
- **Nav accounting:** every label in `navInventory` maps to a route in `visited`. Any label that does NOT → click it, record its route, set `dryPasses = 0`, and loop again.

If you stop before all three are true, you have silently dropped routes — the exact 19→16→10 bug. **Log the proof when you finish:**
```
🧭 Discovery complete: {visited.size} routes, {navInventory.size} nav labels all mapped, {dryPasses} dry passes. frontier empty.
```
The per-action caps further below (timeouts, max clicks per page) still apply — they bound a single page, NOT the loop. The loop runs until the gate passes.

---

### Pass 0 — Static manifests (called from any page via fetch)

These probes use `fetch()` inside the current page — no navigation required. They preserve current page state and work whether the page is HTML or PDF or anything else.

1. `browser_navigate(baseUrl + '/')` (one-time; gives the fetch probes a same-origin context)
2. `browser_evaluate(probe.fetchAndParseSitemap)` — fetches `/sitemap.xml` (and any sub-sitemaps if it's an index), extracts `<loc>` paths
3. `browser_evaluate(probe.fetchAndParseRobots)` — fetches `/robots.txt`, extracts paths after `Disallow:` / `Allow:` lines
4. All harvested paths feed the same normalise+dedup pipeline as Pass 1/2

### Pass 1 — Public routes (unauthenticated context)

1. Already at `baseUrl + '/'` from Pass 0 (no fresh navigation needed unless Pass 0 wasn't run)
2. `browser_evaluate(probe.injectInterceptor)` — install history + hashchange tracker
3. `browser_evaluate(probe.expandCollapsedNav)` — open every collapsed nav group (ARIA toggles *and* non-ARIA parents containing a hidden submenu). Repeat until it returns `expanded === 0` (max 3 rounds) to open nested levels
4. `browser_evaluate(probe.scanNavItems)` returns up to 6 top-level nav-item texts. For each: `browser_hover(text)` then a 400ms wait — reveals hover-only mega menus
5. `browser_evaluate(probe.harvestAnchors)` → list of hrefs
6. `browser_evaluate(probe.readIntercepted)` → returns `{paths, hashes}`
7. Record results:
   - Each anchor href → normalise → `{ path, requiresAuth: false, source: 'anchors' }`
   - Each `paths[]` entry → normalise → `{ path, requiresAuth: false, source: 'intercept' }`
   - Each `hashes[]` entry → `{ path: '/#' + entry, requiresAuth: false, source: 'hashIntercept', kind: 'hash' }`

### Pass 2 — Auth-gated routes (authenticated context)

1. `browser_navigate(baseUrl + loginPath)`
2. Try these typed-in selectors in order until one accepts input: `input[type=email]`, `input[name=email]`, `input[name=username]`, `input[autocomplete=username]`. Use `browser_type` with the email value.
3. `browser_type` on `input[type=password]` with the password value (password is masked in all logs)
4. `browser_click(button[type=submit])` — fallback to the most-prominent visible submit-shaped element if not found
5. `browser_wait_for(time = 5000)` — SPA redirect chain
6. `browser_evaluate("return location.pathname")` — if still equals loginPath, write `loginSucceeded: false` and SKIP Pass 2
7. `browser_evaluate(probe.injectInterceptor)` — re-install tracker on authenticated session
8. **Sidebar tree expansion — ITERATIVE (this is what fills the dropdown gap).** Repeat up to 3 rounds:
   a. `browser_evaluate(probe.expandCollapsedNav)` — opens collapsed groups (ARIA *and* non-ARIA parents containing a hidden submenu). Capture the returned `expanded` count.
   b. `browser_evaluate(probe.harvestAnchors)` **and** `browser_evaluate(probe.harvestRouterAttrs)` — collect the child links the expansion just revealed (a collapsed child only becomes a harvestable `<a href>` AFTER its parent is opened).
   c. If `expanded === 0` for the round → stop (nothing new opened). Otherwise loop — this reveals one nested level per round.
   This ordering matters: expansion BEFORE harvest, repeated, is the fix for collapsed dropdown children that the single-pass flow missed.
9. `browser_evaluate(probe.scanNavItems)` → returns nav labels now visible (including revealed children). For first 6 items: `browser_hover(text)` + 400ms wait — reveal hover menus

10. Run harvest strategies **in this order** (sequence matters — bundle harvest runs LAST so lazy chunks have loaded):

    **a. `probe.harvestAnchors`** — `<a href>` (React/Vue/Next/plain HTML)

    **b. `probe.harvestRouterAttrs`** — `[routerlink]`, `[ng-reflect-router-link]`, `[data-route]`, `[data-href]` (Angular)

    **c. `probe.readIntercepted`** — `pushState` / `replaceState` / `hashchange` history events captured since interceptor was installed

    **d. Click-based nav** — `probe.scanNavItems` returns up to 80 unclicked labels. For each (cap 20 to bound time): `browser_click(text)` → 1.2s wait → re-run `probe.readIntercepted` → re-run `probe.harvestAnchors` to capture any new anchors that appeared. After each click, push the current `location.pathname` to the route set. Continue clicking subsequent items from the SAME starting state (no navigate-back needed — we're collecting URLs not testing routes).

    **e. Service worker cache** — `browser_evaluate(probe.queryServiceWorkerCache)` → enumerates URLs the SW pre-cached. Filter same-origin HTML-shaped paths → add as candidate routes.

    **f. Command palette mining** —
      i.   `browser_press_key("Meta+k")` then 600ms wait
      ii.  `browser_snapshot` — check for a newly-visible dialog/listbox
      iii. If no palette appeared: `browser_press_key("Control+k")` then 600ms wait, snapshot again
      iv.  If still no palette: skip strategy f entirely
      v.   Dispatch Sonnet sub-agent on the snapshot:
           > "This accessibility snapshot includes a command palette dialog. List items that suggest navigating to a route (Go to X, Open Y, View Z). Skip actions like Logout, Create, Delete, Toggle theme. Return JSON array only: `[{ label }]`, cap 10."
      vi.  For each returned label:
           - `browser_press_key("Escape")` to close any leftover state
           - `browser_navigate(baseUrl + '/')` — reset to canonical page
           - 600ms wait
           - `browser_press_key("Meta+k")` (or "Control+k", whichever worked above)
           - 600ms wait
           - For each character of `label.slice(0, 8)`: `browser_press_key(char)` — types the filter
           - 400ms wait
           - `browser_press_key("Enter")`
           - 1500ms wait
           - `browser_evaluate("return location.pathname")` — if pathname changed, record as new route
      vii. After loop: `browser_press_key("Escape")` to ensure clean state

    **g. Bundle string harvest (runs LAST so lazy chunks loaded via strategies a–d are now in `document.scripts`)** —
      i.   `browser_evaluate(probe.listScriptUrls)` — returns up to 10 same-origin script URLs sorted by size
      ii.  For top 5 URLs (or all if fewer): `browser_evaluate(probe.fetchBundleHead, {url})` — returns first 200KB of bundle text
      iii. For each returned chunk, dispatch ONE Sonnet sub-agent:
           > "This is a chunk of a JavaScript bundle from a SPA. Identify every route path declared in any router configuration (React Router, Vue Router, Angular Router, Next.js routes, SvelteKit, TanStack Router, or any other client-side router). Ignore static asset URLs, API endpoints, CSS selectors, regex patterns. Return JSON array only: `[{ path: '/...', source: 'react-router'|'vue-router'|'angular-router'|'next'|'sveltekit'|'unknown' }]`. Cap 80. Output JSON only, no prose."
      iv.  Merge each returned path into the candidate route set with `source: 'bundle'`

### Pass 3 — Per-route enrichment

For each discovered route, run this enrichment block. Process routes in batches per `[resilience].batch_size`.

**Step 3.1 — Tab detection (snapshot + Sonnet, replaces literal `role=tab` matching)**

1. `browser_navigate(route)` + 1500ms wait
2. `browser_snapshot`
3. Dispatch Sonnet sub-agent:
   > "From this accessibility snapshot, list every interactive element that behaves like an IN-PAGE TAB — segmented control, pill switcher, view-state tablist, MUI/Bootstrap/Radix/Headless UI tabs, custom tab components. DO NOT include top-level navigation links to other routes. DO NOT include modal triggers. Return JSON array only: `[{ text, role }]`. Cap 12."
4. For each returned tab text (one at a time):
   - `browser_navigate(route)` — RESET to canonical state (critical: previous click may have shifted the DOM)
   - 1200ms wait
   - `browser_click(text)`
   - 800ms wait
   - `browser_evaluate("return { p: location.pathname, s: location.search, h: location.hash }")`
   - Decide:
     - `p` unchanged AND `s` unchanged AND `h` unchanged → genuine in-page tab → add `text` to `route.tabs[]`
     - `p` unchanged AND `h` changed (`#/sub` or `#tab`) → add `text` to `route.tabs[]` with `kind: 'hashTab'`
     - `p` changed → record as new route with `source: 'tabClick'`; do NOT add to tabs

**Step 3.2 — List → detail discovery**

1. `browser_navigate(route)` + 1500ms wait
2. `browser_snapshot`
3. Dispatch Sonnet sub-agent:
   > "Identify the FIRST repeating-record element on this page (table row, list item, card in a grid). If multiple list types exist, pick the largest. Return JSON only: `{ found: boolean, accessibleName: string, kind: 'row'|'card'|'listitem' }`. One item, the first."
4. If `found: true`:
   - `browser_click(accessibleName)` + 1500ms wait
   - `browser_evaluate("return location.pathname")`
   - If new pathname starts with current route's path → record `{currentRoute}/:id` ONCE per parent, with `exampleId = <last segment of new pathname>`, `source: 'listRowClick'`
   - `browser_navigate(route)` — explicit reset (don't rely on history back)

**Step 3.3 — CTA button mining**

1. `browser_navigate(route)` + 1500ms wait
2. `browser_snapshot`
3. Dispatch Sonnet sub-agent:
   > "List up to 4 primary action BUTTONS on this page whose label suggests routing to a sub-page (Add, Create, New, Edit, Manage, Configure, View Details, Import, Export Settings). Skip destructive actions (Delete, Remove, Cancel) and skip pure toggles/menu openers. Return JSON only: `[{ label }]`."
4. For each returned label:
   - `browser_navigate(route)` — RESET
   - 1200ms wait
   - `browser_click(label)`
   - 1500ms wait
   - `browser_evaluate("return location.pathname + location.search")`
   - `browser_evaluate(probe.detectModalParam)`
   - Decide:
     - `probe.detectModalParam` returned `isModal: true` → record `{currentRoute}?{key}=*` with `kind: 'modal'`, `modalKey: <key>`, `source: 'ctaButton'`. `browser_press_key("Escape")` to close
     - Pathname changed to a sub-path of current route → record as new route, `source: 'ctaButton'`
     - Pathname changed to unrelated path → record as new route, `source: 'ctaButton'`
     - No URL change → not routing, skip

### Pass 4 — Edge-state discovery

1. `probePath = '/__argus_edge_probe_' + runId` (guaranteed not to be a real route)
2. `browser_navigate(baseUrl + probePath)` + 2000ms wait
3. `browser_evaluate("return { p: location.pathname, title: document.title, h1: (document.querySelector('h1')||{}).textContent ? document.querySelector('h1').textContent.trim().slice(0,120) : '' }")`
4. Decide:
   - `p === probePath` → app shows the 404 component in place. Record `{ path: '__not_found__', title, h1Text, kind: '404', source: 'edgeProbe' }`
   - `p !== probePath` → app redirected the 404. Record `{ path: '__not_found__', title, h1Text, kind: '404', redirectsTo: p, source: 'edgeProbe' }` AND make sure `p` is in the main routes set
5. (Optional) Repeat once unauthenticated for completeness

### Pass 5 — Sidebar coverage reconciliation (no silent dropdown miss)

This is the route-discovery finish-gate: it guarantees every clickable sidebar item produced a route, so a dropdown group can never be silently dropped (the failure that lost `/billing-info`, `/promo-code-apply`, `/email-templates` on a prior run).

Run in the authenticated context, from a canonical page (`browser_navigate(baseUrl + '/')` + 1s wait):

1. **Fully expand the sidebar.** Loop `browser_evaluate(probe.expandCollapsedNav)` until it returns `expanded === 0` (max 4 rounds). Every group is now open.
2. **Enumerate every nav label.** `browser_evaluate(probe.scanNavItems)` with the full seen-set → returns every visible nav item label, now including the revealed dropdown children.
3. **Reconcile against discovered routes.** For each label whose text does NOT already correspond to a route in the candidate set:
   - `browser_navigate(baseUrl + '/')` → 800ms wait (reset; Reset-between-actions rule)
   - re-expand if needed so the label is visible, then `browser_click(text)` → 1200ms wait
   - `browser_evaluate("return location.pathname")`
   - If the pathname is a new same-origin route → add it `{ path, requiresAuth: true, source: 'navReconcile' }`
   - If clicking it did nothing (pure parent toggle, no navigation) → it's a group header, not a route; mark resolved
4. **Log the gate result (mandatory):**
   ```
   🧭 Sidebar reconciliation
      Nav items found : {N}
      Mapped to route : {mapped}
      Newly added     : {added}  → {paths}
      Unresolved      : {unresolved}  → {labels}   ← MUST be surfaced, never dropped silently
   ```
   Any `Unresolved` nav label (a clickable item that produced no route and isn't a group header) is logged by name — a sidebar entry must never disappear without a trace. If `unresolved > 0`, the discovery is degraded but continues; the labels tell you exactly what to investigate.

Hard caps for this pass: max 4 expand rounds, max 30 reconcile-clicks, 1.2 s per click — bounded like the other passes.

## Normalisation rules (orchestrator applies after every harvest)

```js
// Pseudocode — apply to every href the orchestrator collects
function normalise(href, baseUrl) {
  const u = new URL(href, baseUrl);
  if (u.origin !== new URL(baseUrl).origin) return null;
  if (/\.(png|jpg|svg|ico|css|js|pdf|zip|woff|ttf|map|json)$/i.test(u.pathname)) return null;
  if (u.pathname.startsWith('/api/')) return null;
  if (/^\/loading(\/|$)/.test(u.pathname)) return null;
  return u.pathname.replace(/\/$/, '') || '/';
}
```

**Detail-route collapsing.** Before dedup, fold actual-id routes into a single template:
- `/users/123`, `/users/456`, `/users/abc-uuid-xyz` → collapse to `/users/:id`
- Detection: if 2+ routes share a parent prefix and differ only in the last segment, AND that segment matches `^[0-9a-fA-F-]{1,40}$` (numeric, hex, or UUID-like) → collapse to `/{prefix}/:id`
- Always retain the first concrete id as `route.exampleId` for later cell navigation

**Dedup by normalised path.** Skip routes in `qa-state.json → routes.skipped`. Cap total routes at 80.

## Output schema

Write to `{project-root}/.tmp/qa-<run-id>/routes.json`:

```json
{
  "runId": "qa-20260520-abc1",
  "discoveredAt": "ISO-8601",
  "app": "myapp",
  "baseUrl": "https://...",
  "loginSucceeded": true,
  "stats": {
    "totalRoutes": 42,

    { "path": "/dashboard",     "title": "Home",            "requiresAuth": true,
      "tabs": ["Overview","Details","History"], "source": "anchors" },
    { "path": "/users/:id",     "title": "User detail",     "requiresAuth": true, "tabs": [],
      "source": "listRowClick", "exampleId": "42" },
    { "path": "/users?modal=*", "title": "User modal",      "requiresAuth": true, "tabs": [],
      "source": "ctaButton", "kind": "modal", "modalKey": "modal" },
    { "path": "/#/legacy",      "title": "Legacy area",     "requiresAuth": true, "tabs": [],

      "source": "edgeProbe", "kind": "404", "h1Text": "Page not found" }
  ]
}
```

Field meanings:
- `source` — which harvest strategy first surfaced this route (used for stats + debugging)
- `kind` — special-route marker for downstream phases: `'tab'`, `'modal'`, `'hash'`, `'404'`, or absent for normal routes
- `exampleId` — only present on `:id` template routes; one concrete id the orchestrator can substitute when generating cells
- `modalKey` — only present on modal-routes; the query-param key (`modal`, `dialog`, etc.) the orchestrator should set to navigate

## Hard limits

| Rule | Value |
|------|-------|
| Max routes | 80 |
| Max scripts scanned for bundle harvest | 10 (top by size) |
| Bundles passed to Sonnet | 5 (top by size, after nav-click strategies completed) |
| Per-bundle chars read | 200,000 |
| Max sitemap entries harvested | 200 |
| Max sub-sitemaps followed if root is an index | 5 |
| Max robots entries harvested | 100 |
| Max SW cache entries harvested | 100 |
| Max command palette items | 10 |
| Max interactive elements clicked per page (exhaustive loop step d) | 60 (`max_interactive_per_page` — bounds runaway pages only; click ALL non-destructive elements up to this) |
| Max nav-click items in strategy d | 20 (legacy single-pass; superseded by the exhaustive loop) |
| Max nav-expand toggles clicked (per call) | 40 |
| Max sidebar expand rounds (iterative) | 3 (Pass 2) / 4 (Pass 5) |
| Max sidebar reconcile-clicks (Pass 5) | 30 |
| Max hover-menu reveals per pass | 6 |
| Max tab candidates per route | 12 |
| Max CTA buttons per route | 4 (legacy; the exhaustive loop now clicks every non-destructive button) |
| Per-page navigate timeout | 20 s |
| Post-login wait | 5 s (SPA redirect chain) |
| Nav click wait | 1.2–1.5 s per item |
| Tab/CTA click wait | 800–1500 ms per action |
| Sitemap/robots fetch timeout | 5 s |
| Bundle fetch timeout | 8 s |
| Edge probe wait | 2 s after navigate |
| Skip | `/api/*`, `/loading/*`, static assets, external origins, logout items |
| Tab classification | Tab is recorded ONLY when URL is unchanged after click |
| Detail-route emission | One `/parent/:id` per parent — never per concrete id |
| Reset-between-actions | Tab/list/CTA loops ALWAYS re-navigate to canonical route between iterations |
| Destructive-action filter | `expandCollapsedNav` skips toggles containing logout/sign-out/delete/remove/disconnect/danger/destroy/terminate/revoke/cancel |

## What this skill CANNOT discover (session-physics limits)

A single-session browser audit has hard physical limits. The skill does not claim to close these — they require config or orchestrator-level changes:

1. **Permission/role-gated routes** — admin-only routes when test account is a regular user; tenant-gated routes; feature-flagged routes. Bundle harvest sees them ONLY if the chunk was served to this user. → Fix: multi-account config in `automation.config.json`.
2. **State-dependent routes** — `/order/confirmation`, OAuth callbacks, magic-link landings, webhook redirect targets. Reachable only after specific side-effects. → Fix: seed-state scripts per app.
3. **Architecture-invisible routes** — Next.js Server Components with no client export; routes resolved entirely by reverse proxy or edge function. → Fix: filesystem read of router source (separate skill).
4. **Multi-tenant / locale variants** — `/fr/users` vs `/en/users`; tenant-A vs tenant-B route sets. → Fix: orchestrator multi-pass over locales/tenants.

Practical expected recall on a single-session crawl: **~98%** for typical SPAs; lower (~85–95%) on heavily permission-gated multi-tenant apps.

## Cost analysis (per audit, added vs the v1 skill)

| Phase | Per audit |
|-------|-----------|
| Pass 0 (sitemap + robots) | $0 (no LLM) |
| Pass 1 (unauthenticated) | ~$0.001 |
| Pass 2 strategies a–d | ~$0.001 |
| Pass 2 strategy e (SW cache) | $0 |
| Pass 2 strategy f (command palette, 1 Sonnet call) | ~$0.003 |
| Pass 2 strategy g (bundle harvest, 5 Sonnet calls) | ~$0.02 |
| Pass 3 enrichment (3 Sonnet calls × ~16 routes typical) | ~$0.03 |
| Pass 4 (edge probe) | $0 |
| **Total added vs v1 skill** | **~$0.05 per audit** |
| **Recall improvement** | ~35–40% → ~98% |

## Fallback when Playwright MCP is unavailable

When MCP is not detected, the orchestrator MUST use the Write+Run pattern (NOT heredoc — see qa-argus Hard Stop Rule #5).

### Required two-step pattern

**Step A — Write the discovery script via the Write tool** to `{project-root}/.tmp/{runId}/discover.cjs`. The script must:

- `require` Playwright from `{project-root}/node_modules/@playwright/test`
- Read `process.env.QA_BASE_URL`, `QA_EMAIL`, `QA_PASSWORD`, `QA_LOGIN_PATH`, `QA_RUN_DIR`
- Implement every probe from the **Probes** section above inline as JavaScript functions
- Run the four-pass strategy (manifests → unauthenticated → authenticated → enrichment → edge)
- Write `{QA_RUN_DIR}/routes.json` directly to disk
- Exit with code 0

**Step B — Run it via the Bash tool** with environment variables set inline:

```bash
QA_BASE_URL="..." QA_EMAIL="..." QA_PASSWORD="..." QA_LOGIN_PATH="/login" QA_RUN_DIR="{abs}/.tmp/{runId}" \
  node "{abs-project-root}/.tmp/{runId}/discover.cjs"
```

Or PowerShell:
```powershell
$env:QA_BASE_URL = "..."
$env:QA_EMAIL = "..."
$env:QA_PASSWORD = "..."
$env:QA_LOGIN_PATH = "/login"
$env:QA_RUN_DIR = "{abs}/.tmp/{runId}"
node "{abs-project-root}/.tmp/{runId}/discover.cjs"
```

### FORBIDDEN patterns

These DO NOT work cross-platform (especially Windows) and MUST NEVER be used:

```bash
# FORBIDDEN — heredoc with embedded JS breaks on Windows
node - <<'EOF'
  const x = `${something}`;
EOF

# FORBIDDEN — node -e with JS containing backticks or quotes
node -e "const x = `foo`;"

# FORBIDDEN — bash -c with JS embedded
bash -c "node -e 'const x = \`foo\`;'"
```

The Write tool sends file content as raw bytes — no shell escaping needed. Always use it for scripts longer than 3 lines or containing JS template literals, regex, or special characters.
